(Note: Before running the code, make sure that root folder is set up properly and the assumed folder exist. In addition, this code is meant to be run on the google Colab, thus there may be side effects when running outside Colab)

**Gesture2Eng.ipynb** - The main notebook where all the coding and process happens

**Hello ASL vid.mp4** - A sample video for the ASL

**yolov3_custom_**** - The weight for YOLO hand detector

**/images** - The resulting parsed image from video "Hello ASL Vid" and its cropped counterpart

**/Kaggle** - A directory to download the Kaggle dataset directly
